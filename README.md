## AP Testing Data

This project focuses on the College Board's AP testing data, with a focus on STEM subjects. The treemap illustrates exam popularity by number of test takers for *all* subjects. The bar graph compares the percentage of males and females who received a certain score on a selected STEM subject(s). Finally, the pie chart breaks down the ethnicities of test takers for a chosen STEM subject.
